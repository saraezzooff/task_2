             <p>My family is very fond of dogs. There are few dogs of different varieties in my family. 
            But among all these dogs Jackie is the name of my favorite dog.</p>
       </div>
       <p class="dog-p">I have chose him because of his few distinct features. Jackie belongs to a famous dog breeds called Labrador retriever. Jackie is of full strong body with chocolate color having black stripe around its neck.

        Jackie is my favorite dog because he is loyal, sincere and he is greatly attached with its master. Jackie is easily teachable.
        
        In a very short period he has learned swimming, understanding and obeying my commands. He quickly picks up my orders and follows them immediately. Jackie is very safe dog.
